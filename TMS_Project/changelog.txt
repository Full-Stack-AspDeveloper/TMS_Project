In tuition management system project, I have developed three panels, first is student panel, second is teacher panel, third is admin panel.The student can select the teacher for tuition after looking at the teacher's qualifications and all the information available there. And the teacher can select the student and request him to study after seeing the student's class and all the information.
And the admin will do the work of managing the panel.All modules and functions work well in this project.
